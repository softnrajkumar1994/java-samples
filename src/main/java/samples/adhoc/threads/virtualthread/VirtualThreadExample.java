/*
Absolutely. Here's a **detailed explanation** of **when to use virtual threads**, not just a summary ‚Äî but with enough clarity for real-world application decisions.

---

## üéØ **When to Use Virtual Threads (in Detail)**

Virtual threads (from Project Loom, Java 21+) are designed to **dramatically improve concurrency and simplify code** for applications that spend a lot of time waiting (i.e., are **I/O-bound**).

Let‚Äôs go use case by use case:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **When You Have a High Volume of Concurrent I/O-bound Tasks**

If your application needs to handle thousands (or even millions) of tasks that mostly wait on:

* **HTTP calls**
* **Database queries**
* **File I/O**
* **Socket communication**

‚Ä¶then virtual threads are a **perfect fit**.

**Why?**

* Virtual threads are **cheap to create** (\~KBs of stack memory vs \~MBs for platform threads).
* They don‚Äôt block carrier threads while waiting ‚Äî freeing them for other work.
* You can write simple, blocking-style code (no complex async chains or callbacks).

üìå **Real-world examples**:

* Web servers or REST APIs handling thousands of clients (e.g., chat app).
* Web scrapers making massive parallel HTTP calls.
* Data processing pipelines that fetch from APIs or DBs.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **When You Want Simpler, Blocking-Style Code Without Sacrificing Scalability**

Before Loom, developers had to choose between:

* ‚úÖ **Blocking code** ‚Äî simple, but scales poorly.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Async/reactive code** ‚Äî scales well, but complex and error-prone.

With virtual threads, you can now:

* Write readable `Thread.sleep()`, `db.query()`, or `httpClient.send()` code.
* Get performance that rivals (or exceeds) reactive code.

üìå **Ideal if you want to escape callback hell, reactive pipelines, or CompletableFuture chains.**

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **When Tasks Are Independent and Don't Share State**

If your app consists of **lots of small, isolated tasks**, each with its own flow (like a request handler), virtual threads shine:

* No need to manage thread reuse.
* Each task can fail independently.
* JVM handles scheduling.

üìå **Example**: Background jobs, request processing, microservices.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **When Platform Thread Limits Are a Bottleneck**

Traditional Java apps can‚Äôt handle more than \~10,000‚Äì50,000 threads (due to OS thread/memory limits).

With virtual threads, you can scale to **millions of concurrent threads** ‚Äî provided:

* Each task doesn‚Äôt use too much heap or native memory.
* Most threads are waiting (not doing heavy CPU work).

üìå **Ideal for server apps with unpredictable traffic peaks.**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **When NOT to Use Virtual Threads**

While they‚Äôre powerful, virtual threads are **not a silver bullet**.

Avoid them in these cases:

---

### ‚ùå 1. **When Tasks Are CPU-Bound**

If your task spends most time in a CPU loop ‚Äî e.g.:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 1_000_000_000; i++) {
    sum += i * i;
}
```

‚Ä¶then virtual threads **won‚Äôt help** ‚Äî they just add scheduling overhead.

Instead:

* Use a **bounded platform thread pool** (`Executors.newFixedThreadPool`)
* Control concurrency based on available CPU cores

üìå **Examples**: video encoding, number crunching, ML inference.

---

### ‚ùå 2. **When Dependencies Don‚Äôt Support Loom Safely**

Some older libraries:

* Use native blocking calls under the hood (e.g., old JDBC drivers)
* Aren‚Äôt virtual-thread-aware (might block carrier threads)

If you call such code from virtual threads, performance can still suffer.

üìå **Mitigation**: Use Loom-compatible drivers (like for PostgreSQL) or async libraries if needed.

---

### ‚ùå 3. **When You Need Real-time Guarantees or OS-Level Control**

Virtual threads are:

* **Scheduled by JVM**, not OS.
* Not suitable for apps needing **real-time latency**, strict **thread priority**, or **hardware affinity**.

üìå **Use case example**: high-frequency trading, real-time embedded systems.

---

## üß† Key Insight

> **Use virtual threads when your bottleneck is ‚Äúwaiting‚Äù rather than ‚Äúworking‚Äù.**

---

## üß™ How to Know If Your App Will Benefit

Ask yourself:

* Does my app make **lots of blocking calls** (HTTP, DB)?
* Is my code full of `CompletableFuture`, `.thenCompose`, or callbacks just to make it non-blocking?
* Do I wish I could just write simple `call()` or `run()` methods for concurrent tasks?
* Does my current app **crash or slow down** with 5,000+ concurrent threads?

If yes ‚Äî virtual threads are **likely** the right fit.
